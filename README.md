During this short workshop, it was introduced Node 4.0.0 and some of the fundamentals changes implemented on it:

* Generators
* Classes and Inheritance
* String Interpolation
* Symbols
* New Built in methods
* etc


As an example, it was presented this application, were you can find a simplistic implementation of a Koa JS based app to post blog messages (original example was directly extracted from Koa's documentation here: https://github.com/koajs/examples/tree/master/blog). Apart from the example, it was reimplemented using some of the ES6 specific features, such as classes, inheritance, constants, string interpolation, etc. Original version from Koa example is in app.js, and alternative implementation is in app2.js (and components folder).
